I met Flare team and knew about the solutions developed by Flare at ETH Oxford back in February 2025. I got a lot of interest in the network that I didn’t know about before and even if I didn’t build anything on Flare at that hackaton, I studied the technology and I wondered if it could be useful for my own project. //Spoiler: it was!//
As my personal project **not directly hackaton-related** I developed a system for satellites to more securely and exchange data among them and with the ground with more trust than currently. Such system will be launched in orbit by 2026 and I have various MoU already present.
However since I participated in the first webinar sessions of the hackaton, I fully understood that Flare could provide to my project an extra added value by creating with Flare a way to actually commercialize space data also on the ground (more is explained in the attached presentation: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yT7lfIBMIgb-LRsZPIO6dgjjhjRmwhMd/view?usp=sharing ), by using FDC to actually as middleman between a potential client on the ground and a data source (currently Copernicus API working to select type of data and area of interest) , Flare blockchain for the payment of the data and VRF to simulate a random price value based on a simulated data demand. The satellite data (real not mocked ) from Copernicus is then passed to an AI assistant to analyze it.
Building with Flare put me in the situation to do web development after long time and challenged myself to make something that one day could generate profit while also having an impact and mix AI , blockchain and space.

# SpaceData Purchase Application

A web application that allows users to purchase satellite data using blockchain technology, combining Copernicus satellite imagery with Flare Network blockchain verification.

## Features

- **Satellite Data Selection**: Search and select satellite data based on location, date range, and data type
- **Blockchain Verification**: Verify the authenticity of satellite data using Flare Data Consensus (FDC)
- **AI Analysis**: Analyze satellite data using AI to extract insights
- **Price Randomization**: Generate random price variations using Flare's Verifiable Random Function (VRF)
- **MetaMask Integration**: Connect to the Flare Network using MetaMask

## Architecture

The application consists of a Python backend that handles all functionality:

1. **Python Backend (Flask)**
   - Serves the UI
   - Handles Copernicus satellite data API
   - Provides AI analysis
   - Handles blockchain integration
   - Connects to Flare Network
   - Manages smart contracts

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js and npm (for Hardhat)
- Git
- MetaMask browser extension
- Flare Coston2 Testnet account with test FLR tokens

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/alfre97x/hackaton-flare-april.git
   cd hackaton-flare-april
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   cd python_backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd ..
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in your own values for the environment variables

### Running the Application

To run the application:

```
# Windows
start-python-server.bat

# Linux/macOS
./start-python-server.sh
```

Then access the application at:
- http://localhost:5000

## Blockchain Integration

The application uses the Flare Network for blockchain functionality:

### Flare Data Consensus (FDC)

FDC is used to provide cryptographic verification of satellite data authenticity:

- **Process Flow**:
  1. The application requests an attestation from the FDC Hub
  2. Flare validators reach consensus on the satellite data
  3. The attestation result is published to the DA Layer API
  4. Our oracle fetches the attestation result and proof
  5. The proof is verified using the FDC Verification contract
  6. The verified data is delivered to our DataPurchase contract

### Smart Contracts

The application uses two main smart contracts:

1. **DataPurchase Contract** (`contracts/DataPurchase.sol`):
   - Handles the purchase of satellite data
   - Verifies data authenticity using FDC
   - Emits events for data requests and deliveries

2. **DataPurchaseRandomizer Contract** (`contracts/DataPurchaseRandomizer.sol`):
   - Interfaces with Flare's VRF for random number generation
   - Provides price randomization for satellite data purchases

### Verifiable Random Function (VRF)

VRF is used to provide transparent, verifiable randomness for price variations:

- **Process Flow**:
  1. When a user views satellite data pricing, a request ID is generated
  2. The application requests randomness from Flare VRF
  3. VRF generates a verifiable random number
  4. The random number is used to apply a price variation (±10%)
  5. The final price is displayed to the user

## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration:

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure the Python server is running
2. Check the console for errors
3. Ensure MetaMask is installed and connected to Flare Coston2 Testnet
4. Verify that the contract addresses in `.env` are correct
5. Check that the Python backend can connect to the blockchain network
6. Verify your Copernicus API credentials if satellite images aren't loading
7. Check network connectivity to both Flare Network and Copernicus API servers
